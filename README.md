# Music Analyzer OBS Plugin

Native OBS Studio plugin that analyzes a music mix and displays an instrument-oriented overlay:

- Drums: bass drum/kick, snare, hi-hat, crash, toms, and ride one-second scrolling hit charts
- Bass: detected note
- Keyboard: three-row piano view covering C1-B6 in two-octave bands, with lower notes folded into octave 1, higher notes folded into octave 6, and detected keys highlighted
- Vocal and other instruments: two-row 12-note octave matrix with active octaves shown as colored text
- Guitar: standard-tuning six-string fretboard view with open string plus frets 1-15 highlighted from detected notes
- Note highlights fade with detected velocity/amplitude so quiet or sustaining notes are dimmer instead of full intensity
- Notes outside the chromatic tuning window, about +/-9 cents from the equal-tempered center, are ignored instead of rounded to the nearest note
- Keyboard, guitar, and other instruments: compact chord labels; vocal stays note-only
- Instrument ownership: mixed sources claim duplicated pitches in bass, keyboard, guitar, vocal, then other order, with harmonic-profile checks allowing same-note keyboard/guitar/other overlaps when the timbre supports it
- Source-name hints: `guitar`, `key`, `piano`, `synth`, `brass`, and `violin` route detection toward the matching row
- Root: rolling 15-second root candidates with confidence, with the primary root held until sustained modulation or silence
- Chords: compact major, minor, power, sus2, sus4, diminished, augmented, 6, minor 6, dominant 7, major 7, minor 7, diminished 7, half-diminished, add9, 9, major 9, and minor 9 labels such as `C`, `Dm`, `Cdim`, `Caug`, `C6`, `Dm6`, `G7`, `Cmaj7`, `Dm7`, `Cdim7`, `Bm7b5`, `Cadd9`, `G9`, `Cmaj9`, and `Dm9`
- Explicit instrument sources use the full chord template set; mixed sources keep conservative chord labels to avoid false extensions from other instruments

The analyzer is designed for real-time OBS use. It uses bounded DSP heuristics rather than a large ML stem-separation model: audio is downmixed into a fixed ring buffer, analyzer windows are copied to a worker thread at a configurable interval, and the OBS audio callback returns immediately after lightweight buffering. The overlay source renders a single reusable RGBA texture.

## OBS Usage

1. Build and install the plugin to your OBS user plugin directory:

   ```sh
   make install-user
   ```

3. Restart OBS.
4. Pick the OBS audio channel that carries the music.
   - If you use the default OBS mixer, use `Desktop Audio`, `Mic/Aux`, or whichever mixer channel meter moves with the music.
   - If you use a source in the `Sources` list, use `Audio Output Capture`, `Audio Input Capture`, or `Media Source`.
5. Add the analyzer filter to that audio channel:
   - In `Audio Mixer`, open the gear/three-dots menu for the channel, then choose `Filters`.
   - Or in `Sources`, right-click an audio source and choose `Filters`.
   - Under `Audio Filters`, click `+`, choose `Music Analyzer Filter`, then click `OK`
6. Add the on-screen overlay:
   - In `Sources`, click `+`
   - Choose `Music Analyzer Overlay`

If the overlay says `ADD MUSIC ANALYZER FILTER TO AN AUDIO SOURCE`, the overlay is loaded but it has not received analyzer data yet. Add `Music Analyzer Filter` to the actual music/audio source, not to the overlay source.

## Build

With the Makefile:

```sh
make
```

If the system OBS headers require SIMDe and `libsimde-dev` is not installed, `make` fetches and extracts that header-only package under `build/deps` without using sudo.

Run the analyzer tests:

```sh
make test
```

`make test` builds standalone analyzer executables outside OBS. `analyzer_smoke` covers the basic signal path, and `analyzer_cases` runs broad synthetic note, instrument, chord, note-matrix, quiet-note rejection, realistic harmonic chord, same-note timbre split, multi-instrument mix, hierarchy, and root-candidate cases, including bass B0-G4, guitar E2-E6, keyboard/other A0-C8, and vocal E2-C6.

Optional CMake build, assuming the OBS development dependencies are installed system-wide:

```sh
/usr/bin/cmake -S . -B build-cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
/usr/bin/cmake --build build-cmake
```

## Performance Notes

The plugin intentionally avoids expensive per-frame work:

- No allocation in the OBS audio callback after source creation.
- Analyzer work runs on a worker thread and drops stale windows instead of queueing unbounded work.
- Fixed 4096-sample windows and configurable update intervals bound CPU use.
- Notes/chords use precomputed Goertzel probes instead of per-callback FFT allocation.
- The overlay updates a single texture at a capped frame rate.

This is approximate mix detection, not true isolated stem separation. For precise separation of crowded mixes, an offline or GPU-backed ML stem separator would be needed before OBS receives the audio.
